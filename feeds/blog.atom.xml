&lt;p&gt;I am moving blogging platforms and thought I should maybe explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I have been hosting my blog on Google&amp;rsquo;s Blogger platform. This has served me pretty well over the years along with the limited number of posts I have made. However, as I have tried to expand the blog into more of a general website, it has been an uphill battle fighting against the workflow of the blogging system itself. I don&amp;rsquo;t forsee wordpress being much different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, one of my reasons for moving to my current setup was simplicity and control. I am using a static site generator now (ala Jekyll). The reasons for this being that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;I now directly control my own content&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t need to set up a wordpress server or anything of the sort&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;There should never be downtime since the site is statically hosted  on Github or S3 or whereever&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Inline with number 1, I can version control my content (with  something simple like git)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;I can write my posts in MarkDown&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;I can embed source code styling instead of reaching out to  JavaScript libraries to do it dynamically at run time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like all these reasons. It also means I can theme the site however I like using simple HTML templates. I can also add whatever types of pages I want since in the end it is just static HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, there are lots of reasons to use a static site generator. I am currently using &lt;a href="https://github.com/greghendershott/frog"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;fr&lt;/strong&gt;zen bl*&lt;em&gt;og&lt;/em&gt;* generator, written in a somewhat lesser known language called Racket (a dialect of Lisp descended from Scheme). I like the Lisp in general and Racket in specific. I want to support its increased usage and the best way to do that is to use projects that use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to port over my old blog posts once I get a chance, although that may prove to be a bit of a chore. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably end up avoiding it for a super long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry></feed>
