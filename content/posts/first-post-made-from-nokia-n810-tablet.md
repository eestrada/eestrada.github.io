First post made from the Nokia N810.
This is an incredible little machine.
It has far exceeded my expectations.
I have already installed the Gizmo SIP application
(I learned that it integrates with Google Voice by design,
making it the clearer choice over Skype).
I can receive calls on the tablet,
albeit with some work arounds.
Hopefully I will have these cleared up soon.
I will post a more thorough step by step review in the next few days
(on a larger keyboard).
For now, let us leave it at how amazing this little machine is:
mind-boggling amazingness.
Adios until next time.

   This is great news: my wife and I are already using Skype on our computers, but I may well change to Gizmo once I jump on a tablet :)
