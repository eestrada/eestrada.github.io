I am generally pretty sad with the number of free tutorials about Houdini rigging.
Thus, I have started a [series of them on youtube](//www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDOYfdOqIB1CFANGg0wOQaZFus67NS4rV).
They aren't polished or even really planned out before hand.
Really, they are little more than just stream of consciousness,
but they have ***information***, which is the important part.
If you are interested in certain topics relating to Houdini rigging,
post a comment and let me know what you want me to cover next.
