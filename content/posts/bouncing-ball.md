Hey all, here is my first animation project as promised.
It is (drum roll) a bouncing ball!
I know it is not terribly exciting and,
like a said before,
my work is of amateur level right now
(which makes sense since I am just starting out).
However, animating a bouncing ball is a good first exercise
for someone learning animation as it teaches principles of timing,
spacing and [squash & stretch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation#Squash_and_stretch).
Instead of focusing on draftsmanship a student can just focus on motion and animation.
At least, that is what the people who know tell me and I am inclined to believe them.
