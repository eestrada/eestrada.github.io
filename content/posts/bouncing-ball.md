Hey all, here is my first animation project as promised.
It is (drum roll) a bouncing ball!
I know it is not terribly exciting and,
like a said before,
my work is of amateur level right now
(which makes sense since I am just starting out).
However, animating a bouncing ball is a good first exercise
for someone learning animation as it teaches principles of timing,
spacing and [squash & stretch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation#Squash_and_stretch).
Instead of focusing on draftsmanship a student can just focus on motion and animation.
At least, that is what the people who know tell me and I am inclined to believe them.

   He does not have a name. You may name him if you like.

   I name him Darwin.

   Darwin seems a good name. By the next animation sample he will have evolved into a sack of flour. Really, he will.

   So, this reminds me a lot of the first programs I wrote. They're super lame by most standards but, because you made them yourself, they're freaking awesome! Looks kind of like animated "Hello World."

   That is a great way to look at it. And the fact that I am in a computer science class right now makes it seem even better of a comparison.
