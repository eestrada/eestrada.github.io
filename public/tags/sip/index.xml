      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some screen shots to assuage your curiosity&#xA;and give you an idea of what this nifty little device can do.&#xA;Keep in mind that somethings may be blurred out&#xA;to protect sensitive information of others and myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is the main page of the tablet.&#xA;As you can see,&#xA;there are a number of widgets that are both pre-installed on the machine&#xA;and that can be download from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://maemo.org/&#34;&gt;maemo.org&lt;/a&gt; website:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First post made from the Nokia N810.&#xA;This is an incredible little machine.&#xA;It has far exceeded my expectations.&#xA;I have already installed the Gizmo SIP application&#xA;(I learned that it integrates with Google Voice by design,&#xA;making it the clearer choice over Skype).&#xA;I can receive calls on the tablet,&#xA;albeit with some work arounds.&#xA;Hopefully I will have these cleared up soon.&#xA;I will post a more thorough step by step review in the next few days&#xA;(on a larger keyboard).&#xA;For now, let us leave it at how amazing this little machine is:&#xA;mind-boggling amazingness.&#xA;Adios until next time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Experiment Begins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some may be wondering what The Nokia Tablet Experiment is,&#xA;or why my wife and I have decided to embark on it.&#xA;So, let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, the reasoning.&#xA;My wife and I are poor college students.&#xA;We currently have a family cellphone plan for the two of us&#xA;with a major mobile phone provider which has recently expired.&#xA;We are paying month to month now&#xA;until we can find a new solution&#xA;or decide to renew our contract for another two years.&#xA;As we have been crunching the numbers for the budget lately&#xA;we have noticed that our phone plan (the cheapest one the provider offers)&#xA;was adding up to about $1000 per year!&#xA;This is with a 14% DISCOUNT tacked on that we received as a promotion!&#xA;That is money that could go towards tuition,&#xA;books for classes,&#xA;dates consisting of more than a walk to the park and a shared $1.50 ice cream cone,&#xA;etc..&#xA;We have shopped around at other mobile phone carriers&#xA;and the price is comparable.&#xA;At most we could save a couple dollars per month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
