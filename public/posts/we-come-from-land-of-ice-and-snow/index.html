Howdy!
It has been quite some time since I last made any updates to this blog.
The reason?
Utter and complete failure in the Nokia Tablet Experiment.
Although I was able to make phone calls via my Nokia tablet,
there were insurmountable problems that plagued the setup of the system.
The biggest problems were due to the ways the university implements their networks
and their wifi.">

<p>Howdy!
It has been quite some time since I last made any updates to this blog.
The reason?
Utter and complete failure in the Nokia Tablet Experiment.
Although I was able to make phone calls via my Nokia tablet,
there were insurmountable problems that plagued the setup of the system.
The biggest problems were due to the ways the university implements their networks
and their wifi.</p>
<p>Thus,
I am going to close down this blog soon.
However,
before I completely close this one down,
I am planning to start another blog that will be more general in nature
so I should actually post on it more often.
Most of it will probably still be about technology
since I prefer not to be overly personal in a public forum such as a blog.</p>
<p>When I get the new blog set up I will post the URL here
so that any of you that actually cared to read my posts will not be left in the dark.</p>
