Part of what took so many years was:</p>
<ol>
<li>I assumed I needed to do something fancy to port them over.</li>
<li>My previous static blog engine (<a href="https://github.com/greghendershott/frog">Frog</a>)
had a limited feature set,
which meant that redirects of paths and whatnot
was an exercise left to the user (i.e. me)
and I never felt it justified the time investment to get create a workaround.</li>

This has served me pretty well over the years along with the limited
number of posts I have made. However, as I have tried to expand the
blog into more of a general website, it has been an uphill battle
fighting against the workflow of the blogging system itself. I don&rsquo;t
forsee wordpress being much different.</p>

<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#skills1">so says Eric S. Raymond</a>). My
journey with Lisp so far hasn&rsquo;t been like that. Instead, it has been a
number of smaller &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moments. In fact, I just had one today. Maybe
my big Zen moment will come later. I guess I&rsquo;ll just need to keep
learning and see where the Lisp journey takes me.</p>

be able to get my nose back to the grindstone on MetaPipe. I&rsquo;m
extremely excited about the tech we are working on for the service and
I can&rsquo;t wait to get it to the point where we can start demoing it

turn into more concrete agreements in the near future.</p>

      <p>Houdini has a nice little function in Python in the <code>hou</code> namespace called <code>hscript</code>.
You can pass in a string for an hscript command.
It passes back out a tuple with stdout and stderr strings.
This is dandy,
but it would be nice to call hscript commands with (in essence) Python syntax.
So I made a little class that does just that.</p>

      <p>Hi y&rsquo;all.
I found this video (UPDATE: previously linked video was an old flash player embed
and no longer exists)
and it got me to thinking about special effects and how we perceive them.
Even though everyone in the studio audience had undoubtedly seen blockbuster films with eye fooling special effects,
they went wild for this performance of a rather simple concept.
Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me;
what they are doing is extremely difficult.
However,
something is often more impressive to us when we can understand the effort put into it.</p>

      <p>From what I have read, it seems that most people have an ultimate Zen
moment with Lisp that makes the universe seem to fall into order (or,
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#skills1">so says Eric S. Raymond</a>). My
journey with Lisp so far hasn&rsquo;t been like that. Instead, it has been a
number of smaller &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moments. In fact, I just had one today. Maybe
my big Zen moment will come later. I guess I&rsquo;ll just need to keep
learning and see where the Lisp journey takes me.</p>

      <p>Houdini has a nice little function in Python in the <code>hou</code> namespace called <code>hscript</code>.
You can pass in a string for an hscript command.
It passes back out a tuple with stdout and stderr strings.
This is dandy,
but it would be nice to call hscript commands with (in essence) Python syntax.
So I made a little class that does just that.</p>

It is more as a reminder to myself about how to do this than anything else.</p>
<p>Earlier today, I was furiously trying to find a utility on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>
to take a CD/DVD
and create an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iso_image">ISO image</a> from it.
I was coming up dry and was feeling a bit frustrated
until I stumbled onto <a href="http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2769/ubuntu_how_to_create_iso_image_from_cd_dvd/">this website</a>.
Once I read it I felt like a complete moron.
Why did I feel so stupid?

for someone learning animation as it teaches principles of timing,
spacing and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation#Squash_and_stretch">squash &amp; stretch</a>.
Instead of focusing on draftsmanship a student can just focus on motion and animation.
At least, that is what the people who know tell me and I am inclined to believe them.</p>

<p>Howdy!
It has been quite some time since I last made any updates to this blog.
The reason?
Utter and complete failure in the Nokia Tablet Experiment.
Although I was able to make phone calls via my Nokia tablet,
there were insurmountable problems that plagued the setup of the system.
The biggest problems were due to the ways the university implements their networks
and their wifi.</p>

        The Experiment Begins

      <p>Some may be wondering what The Nokia Tablet Experiment is,
or why my wife and I have decided to embark on it.
So, let me explain.</p>
<p>First, the reasoning.
My wife and I are poor college students.
We currently have a family cellphone plan for the two of us
with a major mobile phone provider which has recently expired.
We are paying month to month now
until we can find a new solution
or decide to renew our contract for another two years.
As we have been crunching the numbers for the budget lately
we have noticed that our phone plan (the cheapest one the provider offers)
was adding up to about $1000 per year!
This is with a 14% DISCOUNT tacked on that we received as a promotion!
That is money that could go towards tuition,
books for classes,
dates consisting of more than a walk to the park and a shared $1.50 ice cream cone,
etc..
We have shopped around at other mobile phone carriers
and the price is comparable.
At most we could save a couple dollars per month.</p>

      <p>Houdini has a nice little function in Python in the <code>hou</code> namespace called <code>hscript</code>.
You can pass in a string for an hscript command.
It passes back out a tuple with stdout and stderr strings.
This is dandy,
but it would be nice to call hscript commands with (in essence) Python syntax.
So I made a little class that does just that.</p>

I was coming up dry and was feeling a bit frustrated

Once I read it I felt like a complete moron.

      <p>Some may be wondering what The Nokia Tablet Experiment is,
or why my wife and I have decided to embark on it.
So, let me explain.</p>
<p>First, the reasoning.
My wife and I are poor college students.
We currently have a family cellphone plan for the two of us
with a major mobile phone provider which has recently expired.
We are paying month to month now
until we can find a new solution
or decide to renew our contract for another two years.
As we have been crunching the numbers for the budget lately
we have noticed that our phone plan (the cheapest one the provider offers)
was adding up to about $1000 per year!
This is with a 14% DISCOUNT tacked on that we received as a promotion!
That is money that could go towards tuition,
books for classes,
dates consisting of more than a walk to the park and a shared $1.50 ice cream cone,
etc..
We have shopped around at other mobile phone carriers
and the price is comparable.
At most we could save a couple dollars per month.</p>

This is an incredible little machine.
It has far exceeded my expectations.
I have already installed the Gizmo SIP application
(I learned that it integrates with Google Voice by design,
making it the clearer choice over Skype).
I can receive calls on the tablet,
albeit with some work arounds.
Hopefully I will have these cleared up soon.
I will post a more thorough step by step review in the next few days
(on a larger keyboard).
For now, let us leave it at how amazing this little machine is:
mind-boggling amazingness.
Adios until next time.</p>
