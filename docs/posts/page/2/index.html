      <p>Hi y&rsquo;all.
I found this video (UPDATE: previously linked video was an old flash player embed
and no longer exists)
and it got me to thinking about special effects and how we perceive them.
Even though everyone in the studio audience had undoubtedly seen blockbuster films with eye fooling special effects,
they went wild for this performance of a rather simple concept.
Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me;
what they are doing is extremely difficult.
However,
something is often more impressive to us when we can understand the effort put into it.</p>

      <p>Hey all, here is my first animation project as promised.
It is (drum roll) a bouncing ball!
I know it is not terribly exciting and,
like a said before,
my work is of amateur level right now
(which makes sense since I am just starting out).
However, animating a bouncing ball is a good first exercise
for someone learning animation as it teaches principles of timing,
spacing and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation#Squash_and_stretch">squash &amp; stretch</a>.
Instead of focusing on draftsmanship a student can just focus on motion and animation.
At least, that is what the people who know tell me and I am inclined to believe them.</p>

<p>Howdy!
It has been quite some time since I last made any updates to this blog.
The reason?
Utter and complete failure in the Nokia Tablet Experiment.
Although I was able to make phone calls via my Nokia tablet,
there were insurmountable problems that plagued the setup of the system.
The biggest problems were due to the ways the university implements their networks
and their wifi.</p>

This is an incredible little machine.
It has far exceeded my expectations.
I have already installed the Gizmo SIP application
(I learned that it integrates with Google Voice by design,
making it the clearer choice over Skype).
I can receive calls on the tablet,
albeit with some work arounds.
Hopefully I will have these cleared up soon.
I will post a more thorough step by step review in the next few days
(on a larger keyboard).
For now, let us leave it at how amazing this little machine is:
mind-boggling amazingness.
Adios until next time.</p>

        The Experiment Begins

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Some may be wondering what The Nokia Tablet Experiment is,
or why my wife and I have decided to embark on it.
So, let me explain.</p>
<p>First, the reasoning.
My wife and I are poor college students.
We currently have a family cellphone plan for the two of us
with a major mobile phone provider which has recently expired.
We are paying month to month now
until we can find a new solution
or decide to renew our contract for another two years.
As we have been crunching the numbers for the budget lately
we have noticed that our phone plan (the cheapest one the provider offers)
was adding up to about $1000 per year!
This is with a 14% DISCOUNT tacked on that we received as a promotion!
That is money that could go towards tuition,
books for classes,
dates consisting of more than a walk to the park and a shared $1.50 ice cream cone,
etc..
We have shopped around at other mobile phone carriers
and the price is comparable.
At most we could save a couple dollars per month.</p>
