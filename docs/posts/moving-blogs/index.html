<p>In the past I have been hosting my blog on Google&rsquo;s Blogger platform.
This has served me pretty well over the years along with the limited
number of posts I have made. However, as I have tried to expand the
blog into more of a general website, it has been an uphill battle
fighting against the workflow of the blogging system itself. I don&rsquo;t
forsee wordpress being much different.</p>
<p>Besides, one of my reasons for moving to my current setup was
simplicity and control. I am using a static site generator now (ala
Jekyll). The reasons for this being that:</p>
<ol>
<li>I now directly control my own content</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t need to set up a wordpress server or anything of the sort</li>
<li>There should never be downtime since the site is statically hosted
on Github or S3 or whereever</li>
<li>Inline with number 1, I can version control my content (with
something simple like git)</li>
<li>I can write my posts in MarkDown</li>
<li>I can embed source code styling instead of reaching out to
JavaScript libraries to do it dynamically at run time</li>
</ol>
<p>I like all these reasons. It also means I can theme the site however I
like using simple HTML templates. I can also add whatever types of
pages I want since in the end it is just static HTML.</p>
<p>Really, there are lots of reasons to use a static site generator. I am
currently using <a href="https://github.com/greghendershott/frog">frog</a>, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->ozen
bl<!-- raw HTML omitted -->og<!-- raw HTML omitted --> generator, written in a somewhat lesser known
language called Racket (a dialect of Lisp descended from Scheme). I
like the Lisp in general and Racket in specific. I want to support its
increased usage and the best way to do that is to use projects that
use it.</p>
<p>I plan to port over my old blog posts once I get a chance, although
that may prove to be a bit of a chore.  I&rsquo;ll probably end up avoiding
it for a super long time.</p>
